# Applied Data Science Capstone

This is the repository for the project files as part of the **IBM Applied Data Science Capstone** course.

In this capstone project we analyse the SpaceX data. THe project demonstrates the Data Science methodology involving *data collection*, *data wrangling*, *exploratory data analysis*, *data visualization*, *model development*, *model evaluation* and *reporting*. The project is completed using Python programming language. Most of the files (i.e. \*.ipynb) are written in **Jupyter Notebook**.

The files in this repository are:
- **"Lab 1 - Collecting the data.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file containing details on data collection using API.
- **"Lab 2 - Data Collection with Web Scraping.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file containing details on data collection using web scraping.
- **"Lab 3 - Data Wrangling.ipyng"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file containing details on data processing.
- **"Lab 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file to provide initial understanding of the data collected.
- **"Lab 5 - Exploratory Visualization.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file to gain more visual insight on the data collected.
- **"Lab 6 - Data Visualization with Folium.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file to visualize the data collected on a map.
- **"Lab 7 - Dash App.py"** - This is a Python file built as a web application that allow users to interact with the data.
- **"Lab 8 - Machine Learning Prediction.ipynb"** - This is a Jupyter Notebook file to perform the machine learning analysis on the data collected.
- **"ds-capstone-project.pdf"** - This is the final presentation in the pdf format.

The goal in this capstone project is to *predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully*. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of the Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

This course is the final course in the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. The focus is on hands-on work to demonstrate the skills learned in the previous courses.
